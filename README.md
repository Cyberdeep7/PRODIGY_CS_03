# Password Complexity Checker

## Overview
The **Password Complexity Checker** is a simple tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on various security criteria. It helps users create stronger passwords by providing feedback on password length, uppercase and lowercase usage, numbers, and special characters.

## Features
- Checks password length.
- Evaluates the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ensures the inclusion of numbers and special characters.
- Provides real-time feedback on password strength.
- Suggests improvements for weak passwords.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-complexity-checker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd password-complexity-checker
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python projects
   ```

## Usage
Run the tool and input a password to check its strength:
```sh
python password_checker.py
```
Alternatively, if this is a web-based tool, launch it in a browser after running:
```sh
flask run  # If using Flask
```

## Technologies Used
- Python (for logic implementation)
- Flask (if creating a web-based interface)
- JavaScript (if using a frontend UI)

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Add a password generator feature.
- Provide a detailed report on password vulnerabilities.
